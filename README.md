## Background

Connect Light is a platform game, where the player has to dodge obstacles and jump up the tower from peg to peg to reach the top and illuminate the city. 

## Functionality & MVP
* Start, pause and restart the game.
* Jump from one peg to another, making your way to the tower top.
* Avoid randomly-generated birds, flying from all directions.
* Game ends upon running into the bird or falling down the tower or successfully reaching the top.

* In addition, this project will include: 
  * A How to play modal describing the background and rules of the game
  * A production README
  
 ## Wireframes
 
This app will consist of a single screen with game board and nav links to the Github, my LinkedIn, and the How to play modal.

## Implementation Timeline 

* Day1: render triangle representing the character with ability to jump and move left and right, adjust gravity.

* Day2: draw background tower and pegs that player can jump on to move up. Implement game restart upon falling down. Add moving birds and collisions.

* Day3: add sprite animations, lvl completion upon reaching to the top, sound effects.
